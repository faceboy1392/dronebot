# Faceboy's drone bot
A simple little bot designed for the game Nimbatus's Discord server.

This bot will take any `.drn` zip files (which store drones in Nimbatus) and yoinks the drone image and some metadata to preview the drone in the channel.

You can invite it [here.](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1060614689173807225&permissions=34816&scope=bot%20applications.commands)
